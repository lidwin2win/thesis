\section{\uppercase{Module 1:}}
Initially we are going to do a trial and error process where we will try out as many NLP methods and at the same time try out as many Machine learning techniques like classification, prediction etc., Then we are trying to mix Machine learning and NLP feature selection technique. Initially we are working by taking only the Description and Label fields of the Dataset. Then we are going to try the Ensemble methods to see their classification acuracy. So in the second major part we will be making use of the other fields that are available in the dataset.

\section{\uppercase{Module 2:}}
In this phase we will try and finish the Semi-Supervised Learning Method. Then we are planning to do a social network analysis of the creators and moderators of the particular issue, and we are going to include their social networking behaviours to the classification process, So that essentially we give importance to the comments of the people who are really technical people and not some non technical people who may have some less insight into the real nature of the bug.
